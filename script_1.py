Hey! This is my cool Zelda-inspired game menu that I made with Python.

## What it is
It's called "Zelda The Lich King Tales" - basically a fantasy adventure game menu with an epic story about fighting an evil Lich King. Pretty awesome, right?

## What you need
- Python (obviously)
- Arcade library: `pip install arcade`
- Your background image: name it `generated_image.png`
- Music file: `gerudo_valley.wav` (the metal version is sick!)

## How to run it
Just do: `python my_zelda_game.py`

## Controls
- Arrow keys to move around the menu
- Enter to pick something
- Escape to go back or quit

## Cool features
- Epic title with red glowing effect (looks so Zelda!)
- Your custom AI background image
- Floating sparkles that move around
- Metal Gerudo Valley music (if you have the file)
- Multiple screens: main menu, game start, settings, about

## Files you need
```
my_zelda_game.py        <- the main game (this file)
generated_image.png     <- your background image
gerudo_valley.wav       <- the awesome music
```

## Getting the music
I can't include the music file because of copyright stuff, but you can:
1. Go to YouTube: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xrZRg4R8Qx0
2. Use any YouTube downloader to get it as WAV
3. Name it `gerudo_valley.wav` and put it in the same folder

## The story
You're a hero who has to defeat the evil Lich King who cast a dark spell over Hyrule. Pretty classic fantasy stuff but it's fun!

Made this for fun - hope you like it!
