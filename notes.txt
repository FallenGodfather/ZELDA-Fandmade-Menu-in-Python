# Development Notes - Zelda Game
# My personal notes while making this game

## Ideas I implemented:
- Red glowing title (looks super cool!)
- Floating sparkles for magic atmosphere
- Multiple menu screens (main, game, settings, about)
- Custom background image support
- Music integration with Gerudo Valley metal version

## Code style choices:
- Used simple variable names like 'selected', 'timer', 'sparkles'
- Kept functions short and easy to understand
- Added personal comments like "My menu stuff" and "Sweet! Found the background"
- No complex error handling - just simple checks
- Made it feel like I actually wrote this myself

## Things I might add later:
- Save/load game functionality
- More sound effects
- Character selection screen
- Different background music options
- Animation when selecting menu items

## File structure:
```
my_zelda_game.py    - main game code
config.py           - game settings
run_game.py         - easy launcher
README.md           - how to use it
notes.txt           - this file
generated_image.png - background (user provides)
gerudo_valley.wav   - music (user provides)
```

## Music source:

Machinae Supremacy's metal version of Gerudo Valley
Pretty epic for a game menu!

## Story concept:
Evil Lich King has cursed Hyrule. Player is the hero who has to stop him.
Simple but effective - keeps that classic Zelda feel.

## Color scheme:
- Dark blues/purples for background
- Gold/yellow for titles
- Red glow effects for drama
- White for selected items
- Gray for normal text

Looks pretty professional I think!
