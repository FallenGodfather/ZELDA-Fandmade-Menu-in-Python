# Development Notes - Zelda Game
# My personal notes while making this game

## Ideas I implemented:
- Red glowing title (looks super cool!)
- Rain effects on menu (changed from sparkles)
- Multiple menu screens (main, game, settings, about)
- Custom background image support
- Music integration with Gerudo Valley metal version
- **FULL PLAYABLE FIRST LEVEL!**
- Link character with movement and combat
- NPC dialogue system with Jude
- Enemy mobs with patrol and chase AI
- King Kong-like boss battle
- Particle effects for hits and deaths
- Scrolling camera system
- Health and combat mechanics
- Chalice collection objective

## Code style choices:
- Used simple variable names like 'selected', 'timer', 'player'
- Kept functions short and easy to understand
- Added personal comments like "My menu stuff" and "Sweet! Found the background"
- Simple but effective game mechanics
- Made it feel like I actually wrote this myself
- Used basic shapes instead of sprite files for that 16-bit feel

## Game Design - Level 1:
**Story:**
- Link wakes up on deserted island
- Meets old Jude who guides him
- Must find sacred Chalice in Old Palace
- Fights mobs along the way
- Boss guardian appears when chalice is taken

**Gameplay:**
- WASD/Arrow keys for movement
- SPACE for attack and interaction
- Simple collision with walls
- Enemy AI: patrol when idle, chase when player nearby
- Boss follows player and takes more damage
- Health system with invincibility frames
- Particle effects for visual feedback

**Visual Style:**
- Sandy beach ground with color variation
- Water around island edges
- Brown stone walls for boundaries
- Gray stone palace structure
- Golden chalice with glow effect
- Simple colored shapes for characters
- Palm trees for atmosphere
- Particle effects for impacts

## Things I might add later:
- More levels
- More enemy types
- Power-ups and items
- Sound effects for attacks
- Better animations
- Save/load game functionality
- Character upgrades

## File structure:
```
my_zelda_game.py    - main game code with full level
config.py           - game settings
run_game.py         - easy launcher
README.md           - how to use it
notes.txt           - this file
generated_image.png - background (user provides)
gerudo_valley.wav   - music (user provides)
.gitignore          - ignore python cache files
```

## Music source:

Machinae Supremacy's metal version of Gerudo Valley
Pretty epic for a game!

## Story concept:
Evil Lich King has cursed Hyrule. Link starts on a deserted island (inspired by Link's Awakening). 
He must collect the Chalice from the Old Palace to continue his quest. The boss is a 
King Kong-like guardian protecting the palace. Simple but effective - keeps that classic Zelda feel.

## Color scheme:
**Menu:**
- Dark blues/purples for background
- Gold/yellow for titles
- Red glow effects for drama
- White for selected items
- Gray for normal text

**Game:**
- Sandy brown for island ground (194, 178, 128)
- Blue for ocean water (70, 130, 180)
- Green for Link (50, 200, 50)
- Red for enemies (200, 50, 50)
- Brown for boss (100, 50, 25)
- Gold for chalice (255, 215, 0)

Looks pretty professional I think!
