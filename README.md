## Game Story - Level 1
Link opens his eyes on a mysterious deserted island. An old man named Jude approaches and explains that the Lich King's curse has brought Link here. To escape and continue his quest, Link must find the sacred Chalice hidden in the Old Palace to the northeast. But the path is treacherous - dark creatures patrol the island, and a mighty beast guards the palace entrance!
